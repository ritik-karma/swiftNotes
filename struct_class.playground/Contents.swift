//MARK:  Memory ARC(Automatic Reference Counting) (Only in classes)
/*
 
 ARC automatically frees up the memory used by class instances when those instances are no longer needed.
 
 For each object it holds the count that how much refrences are pointing to this object.
 Used for deallocating the object means you have done work  with object or not allocated to any another var . now you want to nil it but not mannually.
 
 working:
    • When you create an instance of a class, ARC sets its reference count to 1.
     •    Every time you assign that instance to a new variable or constant, ARC increases the reference count by 1.
     •    When a reference to the instance is removed, ARC decreases the reference count by 1.
     •    When the reference count reaches 0, ARC deallocates the instance, freeing up memory.
 
 3 Methods:-
 
 Strong (Default) : Previouslly we are using 'strong' method which is mannually nilling.
 
 weak: Can accept optional values
 
 unowned: Won't accept optional values.
